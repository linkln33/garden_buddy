   - Treatment table (pesticide name, dosage, frequency, natural alt)

2. **Pull data from**:
   - EU Pesticide DB (CSV)
   - AGRIS API (per disease name)
   - FAO OpenFoodTox (toxicity + safety)
   - National guides (e.g. Benaki, AKIS)

3. **Normalize the data**
   - Translate to common dosage units (e.g. ml/L, kg/ha)
   - Store per disease + crop combination

4. **Query based on**:
   - Diagnosed disease → Suggest treatment(s) by region
   - Crop selected by user → Fetch known issues + prevention

5. **Filter by settings**:
   - 🌱 Organic toggle → Only natural remedies
   - 🧪 Show toxicity or MRL warnings based on EU regulations
