   FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');
   
   -- Allow public read access
   CREATE POLICY "allow_public_read" ON storage.objects
   FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'plant-images');
   
   -- Allow users to manage their files
   CREATE POLICY "allow_user_management" ON storage.objects
   FOR ALL USING (auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
   ```

### Issue #2: Community Voting Not Working

   ```typescript
   // Get weather data by coordinates
   // Include humidity, temperature, precipitation
   // Return spray recommendations based on conditions
   ```

3. **Update Weather Component** (`/src/components/weather/WeatherWidget.tsx`)
   - Display current conditions
   - Show spray timing recommendations
   - Add weather-based alerts

### Win #2: Enhanced Dashboard with Real Data
**Value**: Better user engagement and retention
**Effort**: Medium
**Timeline**: 2-3 days

#### Implementation Steps:
1. **Fix Recent Diagnoses Display**
   - Query user's recent diagnoses from database
   - Show thumbnails and confidence scores
   - Add click-through to diagnosis details

2. **Add Weather Widget to Dashboard**
   - Show current conditions for user's location
   - Display spray recommendations
   - Include humidity and temperature alerts

3. **Improve Community Feed Integration**
   - Show recent community activity
   - Display voting statistics

**Effort**: Low (browser geolocation API)
**Timeline**: 3-4 days

#### Implementation Plan:
1. **Add Geolocation to Image Upload**
   ```typescript
   // Get user's current position
   navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()
   // Store coordinates with diagnosis
   // Display location on diagnosis details
   ```

2. **Create Field Management System**
   - Allow users to name and tag fields
   - Track diagnoses by field location
   - Show field-specific history

### Enhancement #2: Push Notifications
**Value**: Proactive user engagement
**Effort**: Medium (Firebase FCM setup)
**Timeline**: 4-5 days

#### Implementation Plan:
1. **Set up Firebase Cloud Messaging**
   - Create Firebase project
   - Add FCM configuration
   - Implement service worker for notifications

2. **Create Notification Types**
   - Weather alerts for spray timing
   - Treatment reminders
   - Community activity notifications
   - New diagnosis results

### Enhancement #3: Voice Interface (Accessibility)
**Value**: Hands-free operation for field use
**Effort**: Medium (Web Speech API)
**Timeline**: 5-6 days

#### Implementation Plan:
1. **Add Voice Commands**
   ```typescript
   // "Take photo" - trigger camera
   // "Read diagnosis" - speak results aloud
   // "Navigate to dashboard" - voice navigation
   ```

2. **Implement Text-to-Speech**
   - Read diagnosis results aloud
   - Speak treatment recommendations
   - Provide audio feedback for actions
