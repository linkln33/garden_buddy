## 🧠 AI Integration Strategy

### GPT-4 Vision Prompts

For disease detection:
```
You are an expert agricultural pathologist. Analyze this image of a plant leaf and:
1. Identify the most likely disease affecting this plant
2. Provide a confidence score (0-100%)
3. List the key visual symptoms you observed
4. Rate the severity (mild, moderate, severe)
5. Suggest if community review is needed for this diagnosis

Plant type: [PLANT_TYPE]
```

For treatment recommendations:
```
As an agricultural expert, provide treatment recommendations for [DISEASE_NAME] on [PLANT_TYPE]:

1. Organic treatment options (at least 3, ranked by effectiveness)
2. Chemical treatment options (at least 3, ranked by effectiveness)
3. Preventive measures to avoid recurrence
4. Application timing and frequency
5. Safety precautions for each treatment

Prefer treatments that are widely available and cost-effective for small-scale farmers.
```
