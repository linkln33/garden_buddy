## Troubleshooting

If you're still experiencing upload issues after setting up the bucket and policies:

1. Check that your Supabase URL and anon key in `.env.local` are correct
2. Ensure you're properly authenticated before attempting to upload
3. Check browser console for detailed error messages
4. Verify that the image file size is under the limit (5MB)
5. Make sure the image format is supported (JPEG, PNG, WebP)

After making these changes, restart your development server for the changes to take effect.
